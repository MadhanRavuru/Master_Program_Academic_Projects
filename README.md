# Master Program Academic Projects

This repositry contains the projects done during my Master Program at Technical University of Munich (TUM). All projects are related to Machine Learning. This repository includes 6 different course projects. The brief introduction to these course projects can be seen below.

## Data Mining Lab:
This course is about descriptive and predictive mining on dataset. We worked with two datasets in this lab course: UK road safety and NHTSA car rating dataset. We study about the road accidents from UK road safety dataset and car ratings based on crash tests from NHTSA dataset. We want to analyse how closely the real world accidents are related to standard crash tests. Our aim is to pursue anything related to car safety.

## I2dl:
I2dl -  Introduction to Deep Learning. This section covers basic deep learning tasks like classification, segmentation, etc.

## MLGSD:
MLGSD- Machine Learning for Graphs and Sequential Data. This contains projects on  Variational Autoencoders, Robustness Analysis, Sequential data and Graphs.

## MLMI lab:
MLMI - Machine Learning in Medical Imaging. This is lab course at TUM. Our goal was to perform Hyperparameter Optimization using Ant Colony Optimization algorithms. We worked wth MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ISIC datasets for the task.

## Machine Learning:
This include worksheets and exercise codes from Machine Learning course.

## TDCV:
TDCV - Tracking and Detection in Computer Vision. This folder includes tasks related to non-linear optimization of reprojection error, Random Forest based Object detection and Pose estimation

## Master Thesis Project:
Thesis project on **Multi-Domain Learning for Multi-Output Classification of Red Blood Cells**. 

_Abstract:_ Hematologists use their experience to identify Red Blood Cell (RBC) disorders. Manual examination of cells are time-consuming, labour-intensive and subjective. RBCs are highly deformable and vary in size, shape, hemoglobin distribution and inclusion, making manual classification tedious. Classification of unstained cells become even more problematic since the hematologists recognize features enhanced by the staining process. This thesis investigates the use of Machine Learning models - particularly Deep Learning algorithms - to address above mentioned problem. Firstly, RBCs are detected fromblood smear images and cropped. Then, the center cell is extracted from each crop using Segmentation, with special handling of touching and overlapping cells. The hand-crafted features are derived from extracted center cell crops using Feature Engineering and analyzed. Later, Multi-Output Classification is performed on the cell to predict its properties. Comparison is made between extracted and learnt features using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Finally, Domain Adaptation is used in supervised and unsupervised fashion to learn from stained and unstained images for cell classification. The proposed Image Recognition Artificial Intelligence (AI) can revolutionize medical diagnostics, thereby making it cheaper and more accessible.
