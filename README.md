# Master Program Academic Projects

This repositry contains the projects done during my Master Program. All projects are related to Machine Learning.

## Data Mining Lab:
This course is about descriptive and predictive mining on dataset. We worked with two datasets in this lab course: UK road safety and NHTSA car rating dataset. We study about the road accidents from UK road safety dataset and car ratings based on crash tests from NHTSA dataset. We want to analyse how closely the real world accidents are related to standard crash tests. Our aim is to pursue anything related to car safety.

## I2dl:
I2dl -  Introduction to Deep Learning. This section covers basic deep learning tasks like classification, segmentation, etc.

## MLGSD:
MLGSD- Machine Learning for Graphs and Sequential Data. This contains projects on  Variational Autoencoders, Robustness Analysis, Sequential data and Graphs.

## MLMI lab:
MLMI - Machine Learning in Medical Imaging. This is lab course at TUM. Our goal was to perform Hyperparameter Optimization using Ant Colony Optimization algorithms. We worked wth MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ISIC datasets for the task.

## Machine Learning:
This include worksheets and exercise codes from Machine Learning course.

## TDCV:
TDCV - Tracking and Detection in Computer Vision. This folder includes tasks related to non-linear optimization of reprojection error, Random Forests and Pose estimation
