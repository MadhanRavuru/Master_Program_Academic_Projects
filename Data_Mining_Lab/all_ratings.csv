Following additional, rigorous testing of the Volt's battery packs that resulted in a subsequent fire as well as an incident in which the battery emitted smoke and sparks, the agency has launched a safety defect investigation of potential post-crash fires in Chevy Volts. <a href=""http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/NHTSA+Statement+on+Conclusion+of+Chevy+Volt+Investigation"">Read NHTSA statement on the Volt</a>",,http://www.safercar.gov/staticfiles/DOT/safercar/ncapmedia/images/2011/v07394P038.jpg,http://www.safercar.gov/staticfiles/DOT/safercar/ncapmedia/movies/2011/v07394C012.wmv,Standard,No,No,,20,1,1,2011,CHEVROLET,VOLT,2011 Chevrolet Volt 4 DR FWD,232
