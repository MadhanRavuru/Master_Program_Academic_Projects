## Data Mining Lab:

This lab course is about descriptive and predictive mining on car safety dataset. We worked with two datasets in this lab course: UK road safety and NHTSA car rating dataset. 
We linked both the datasets by matching car model/year combinations. Our goal was to check whether real world accidents and standard crash tests are aligned. 

Please refer to [our final presentation](./Final_Presentation.pdf) regarding the details. We are team of 4 people, who worked on this project.
