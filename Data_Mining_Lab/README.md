## Data Mining Lab:

This lab course is about descriptive and predictive mining on car safety dataset. We worked with two datasets in this lab course: UK road safety and NHTSA car rating dataset. 
We linked both the datasets by matching car model/year combinations. Our goal was to check whether real world accidents and standard crash tests are aligned. 

Please refer to [our final presentation](Final Presentation v3.1.pdf) regarding the details.
