Because of that, word vectors of similar words should be close together. Models that use word vectors can utilize these properties, e.g., in sentiment analysis a model will learn that \"good\" and \"great\" are positive words, but will also generalize to other words that it has not seen (e.g. \"amazing\") because they should be close together in the vector space.\n","\n","Vectors can keep other language properties as well, like analogies. The question \"a is to b as c is to ...?\", where the answer is d, can be answered by looking into word vector space and calculating $\\mathbf{u}_b - \\mathbf{u}_a + \\mathbf{u}_c$, and finding the word vector that is the closest to the result.\n","\n","## Your task\n","Complete the missing code in this notebook. Make sure that all the functions follow the provided specification, i.e. the output of the function exactly matches the description in the docstring. \n","\n","We are given a text that contains $N$ unique words $\\{ x_1, ..., x_N \\}$. We will focus on the Skip-Gram model in which the goal is to predict the context window $S = \\{ x_{i-l}, ..., x_{i-1}, x_{i+1}, ..., x_{i+l} \\}$ from current word $x_i$, where $l$ is the window size. \n","\n","We get a word embedding $\\mathbf{u}_i$ by multiplying the matrix $\\mathbf{U}$ with a one-hot representation $\\mathbf{x}_i$ of a word $x_i$. Then, to get output probabilities for context window, we multiply this embedding with another matrix $\\mathbf{V}$ and apply softmax. The objective is to minimize the loss: $-\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}[P(S|x_i;\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{V})]$.\n","\n","You are given a dataset with positive and negative reviews.
