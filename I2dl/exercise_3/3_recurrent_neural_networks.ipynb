A RNN is class of neural networks where the output not only depends on the current input but also on previous inputs along a given input sequence. This allows to exhibit temporal dynamic behaviour and contextual information in a sequence. Common applications for RNN are:\n","\n","- time series analysis\n","- speech recognition\n","- machine translation\n","- image captioning\n","\n","\n","Goal of this exercise\n","========\n","\n","This exercise notebook should help you to experiment how recurrent neural networks are implemented, trained, and used for computer vision problems. Therefore, this notebook is structured as follows:\n","1. Implement your own simple RNN class in Pytorch.\n","2. Explore the backpropagation of the gradients in the RNN and discuss the vanishing gradient problem.\n","3. Implement your own LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) Network and show that this architecture improves the vanishing gradient problem.\n","4. Build a RNN classifier for the MNIST dataset and train your model.\n","5. Tune the hyperparameters of your model and submit your best model to the server to get bonus points.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"sAYh14xz22g5","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"outputId":"7359bc34-7bd8-4b52-9199-f1b9296bcd3b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1562778693055,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":45524,"user":{"displayName":"MADHAN R","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mWzTthe7iNg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC2U/TXibL5IJ0ho/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"05574385187242124520"}}},"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive')\n","root_path = 'gdrive/My Drive/I2dl/exercise_3'    #project folder directory"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Go to this URL in a browser: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?client_id=947318989803-6bn6qk8qdgf4n4g3pfee6491hc0brc4i.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=urn%3Aietf%3Awg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&scope=email%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdocs.test%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fdrive.photos.readonly%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fpeopleapi.readonly&response_type=code\n","\n","Enter your authorization code:\n","··········\n","Mounted at /content/gdrive\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-ztYZXvX22yy","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"9176ad6e-a561-4dbf-c659-6200fcc49c98","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1562778704900,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":635,"user":{"displayName":"MADHAN R","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mWzTthe7iNg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC2U/TXibL5IJ0ho/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"05574385187242124520"}}},"source":["%cd 'gdrive/My Drive/I2dl/exercise_3'"],"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/content/gdrive/My Drive/I2dl/exercise_3\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"lpBAnJhm2r7C","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":51},"outputId":"5c7ff078-d36e-4c5f-9b0c-c67b6b25cffd","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1562778708947,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":480,"user":{"displayName":"MADHAN R","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mWzTthe7iNg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC2U/TXibL5IJ0ho/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"05574385187242124520"}}},"source":["import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import torch\n","from torch.autograd import Variable\n","import os\n","\n","device = torch.device(\"cuda:0\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n","\n","%matplotlib inline\n","plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (10.0, 8.0) # set default size of plots\n","plt.rcParams['image.interpolation'] = 'nearest'\n","plt.rcParams['image.cmap'] = 'gray'\n","\n","# for auto-reloading external modules\n","# see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1907993/autoreload-of-modules-in-ipython\n","%load_ext autoreload\n","%autoreload 2"],"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["The autoreload extension is already loaded.
