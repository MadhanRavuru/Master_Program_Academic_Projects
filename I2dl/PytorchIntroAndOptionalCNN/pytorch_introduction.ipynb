The package provides automatic differentiation for all operations on Tensors. PyTorch is a define-by-run framework, which means that the calculation of gradients ( e.g. during backpropagation) is defined at runtime and can be different at every single iteration.\n","\n","Since pytorch 0.4.0, the Tensor class includes the Variable class, and supports nearly all of its operations. Once a computational graph for a Tensor that requires gradients is executed the ``Tensor.backward()`` method can be used to automatically compute all the gradients.\n","\n","If the ``Tensor`` is not a scalar, the ``backward()`` method requires an additional ``grad_output`` argument which matches the shape of the ``Tensor``. ``grad_output`` is supposed to be the gradient w.r.t the given output. For a scalar ``Tensor`` ``grad_output`` is assumed to be `torch.Tensor([1.0])`.\n","\n","The `autograd` package additionally provides a `Function` class which encodes a complete history of computation. Each `Tensor` with the `required_grad` attribute has a ``Tensor.grad_fn`` attribute which references the ``Function`` (e.g. an operation such as addition) that created the respective ``Tensor`` and thereby determines its gradient. For Tensors that were created by the user and not as a result of an operation the ``grad_fn`` attribute is ``None``.\n","\n","The following simple examples will illustrate the basic concepts of the ``autograd`` package."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"OrCqvMVdJHLm","colab_type":"code","outputId":"6c484714-a942-4e44-a689-d0e6b7cedcb3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1562516461966,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":603,"user":{"displayName":"MADHAN R","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mWzTthe7iNg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC2U/TXibL5IJ0ho/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"05574385187242124520"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["# In general, tensors don't track gradients\n","x = torch.ones(1)\n","x.requires_grad"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["False"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":9}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8dSH9TMHJHLq","colab_type":"code","outputId":"e4529a80-2a49-459a-b9b2-c969122ab124","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1562516477112,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":976,"user":{"displayName":"MADHAN R","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mWzTthe7iNg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC2U/TXibL5IJ0ho/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"05574385187242124520"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["# Thus we can't call the backward function on these tensors\n","try:\n","    x.backwards()\n","except AttributeError:\n","    print(\"Doesn't work...\")"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Doesn't work...\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"3zKTOTTpJHLv","colab_type":"code","outputId":"9b3aa581-c910-42b6-f2fd-cdbe3579f881","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1562516494960,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":933,"user":{"displayName":"MADHAN R","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mWzTthe7iNg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC2U/TXibL5IJ0ho/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"05574385187242124520"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":51}},"source":["# Enable gradient tracking\n","x = torch.ones((2, 2), requires_grad=True)\n","print(x)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["tensor([[1., 1.],\n","        [1., 1.]], requires_grad=True)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dQMexId5JHL2","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Apply an operation to the `Tensor`:\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"C0N4O7cpJHL3","colab_type":"code","outputId":"d7e961df-a46d-4351-a1f1-7934e672d5f8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1562516516894,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":555,"user":{"displayName":"MADHAN R","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mWzTthe7iNg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC2U/TXibL5IJ0ho/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"05574385187242124520"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":51}},"source":["y = x + 2\n","print(y)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["tensor([[3., 3.],\n","        [3., 3.]], grad_fn=<AddBackward0>)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UQ5XAznxJHL7","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Since ``y`` was created as a result of an operation it has a ``grad_fn`` attribute (`Function`) unequal to `None`:\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"z5OlT54CJHL8","colab_type":"code","outputId":"7227a977-6c10-4cdf-9495-21277f98f21a","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1562516545086,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":965,"user":{"displayName":"MADHAN R","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mWzTthe7iNg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC2U/TXibL5IJ0ho/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"05574385187242124520"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34}},"source":["print(y.grad_fn)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["<AddBackward0 object at 0x7f79bbc27400>\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VFyz6nP8JHMA","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Applying more operations to `y` increases the computational graph:\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"WjbZnJCQJHMB","colab_type":"code","outputId":"2c445aa8-716b-48c8-c777-e2b7bdfcefcb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1562516570650,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":586,"user":{"displayName":"MADHAN R","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mWzTthe7iNg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC2U/TXibL5IJ0ho/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"05574385187242124520"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":68}},"source":["z = y * y * 3\n","out = z.mean()\n","\n","print(z)\n","print(out)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["tensor([[27., 27.],\n","        [27., 27.]], grad_fn=<MulBackward0>)\n","tensor(27., grad_fn=<MeanBackward0>)\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LcAhG9-1JHMI","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Gradients\n","---------\n","The gradient w.r.t the input `x` can now be computed (backpropagated) with ``out.backward()``.
